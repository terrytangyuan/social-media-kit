### üêõ Bug Fixes

- **Fixed missing copy button in Mastodon post preview**: Added individual copy buttons for Mastodon thread chunks, bringing it in line with Twitter and Bluesky functionality

## v0.2.2

### üè∑Ô∏è New Features
- Added Mastodon support
- Added X Premium support
- Automatically convert URLs in BlueSky posts to clickable links using AT Protocol facets
- Added Welcome page
- Supports text formatting for numbers and greek letters
- Added resizer in editor area for longer posts

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Text Formatting
- **Fixed italic text formatting not working**: Resolved issue where text was rendered as `_sometext_` instead of converting to italic Unicode characters
- **Fixed italic formatting with punctuation**: Text formatting now works correctly with exclamation marks and other punctuation (e.g., `_hello!_`, `_text_!`)
- **Improved regex pattern for italic detection**: Updated from restrictive word-boundary pattern to flexible pattern that works in all contexts while preserving @ mention protection

#### User Interface
- **Fixed Mastodon handles not displayed after editing**: Added missing Mastodon display section in person mappings view alongside LinkedIn, Twitter, and Bluesky
- **Improved person mappings layout**: Updated responsive grid from 3-column to 4-column layout to accommodate all platforms

#### BlueSky Tagging
- **Fixed BlueSky mentions not being clickable**: Implemented AT Protocol facets to make mentions properly clickable
- **Added handle-to-DID resolution**: Automatically resolves BlueSky handles to DIDs for proper mention linking
- **Smart fallback for missing handles**: When BlueSky handle is not set, properly falls back to display name without trying to resolve it
- **Fixed mentions followed by punctuation**: Improved regex pattern to correctly handle mentions like `@{Name}.` and `@{Name}!`
- **Fixed BlueSky handles with trailing periods**: Resolved issue where `@terrytangyuan.xyz.` would include the trailing period in the handle, preventing proper resolution
- **Fixed spacing sensitivity bug**: BlueSky tags now work correctly whether followed by one space or multiple spaces after punctuation (e.g., both `@{Name}. text` and `@{Name}.  text` now work)
- **Fixed display name handling**: When no social media handle is specified for a person, unified tags now convert to just the display name without the `@` symbol:
  - **BlueSky**: `@{John Doe}` becomes `John Doe` instead of `@John Doe` when no BlueSky handle is set
  - **Twitter**: `@{Jane Smith}` becomes `Jane Smith` instead of `@Jane Smith` when no Twitter handle is set
- **UTF-8 byte position accuracy**: Correctly calculates byte positions for facets to ensure proper mention detection


## v0.2.1


### üè∑Ô∏è New Features

#### Unified Tagging System
- **Cross-Platform Tagging**: Introduced `@{Person Name}` syntax for unified tagging across all platforms
- **Smart Platform Conversion**: Automatically converts unified tags to platform-specific formats:
  - LinkedIn: Uses display name format (e.g., `@Yuan Tang`) with manual tagging required
  - Twitter/X: Uses username format (e.g., `@TerryTangYuan`) for automatic clickable mentions
  - Bluesky: Uses handle format (e.g., `@terrytangyuan.xyz`) for automatic clickable mentions
- **Tag Manager UI**: Dedicated interface for managing person mappings
  - Visual tagging guide with examples for each platform
  - Easy insertion of unified tags into posts
  - Clear instructions and help text for LinkedIn's manual tagging requirements
- **Persistent Storage**: All person mappings automatically saved to localStorage
