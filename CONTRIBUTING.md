## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our [code standards](#code-standards)

3. **Write/update tests** for your changes (see [Testing](#testing))

4. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   npm test                    # Run all tests
   npm run test:watch         # Run tests in watch mode
   npm run test:coverage      # Check test coverage
   ```

5. **Build and verify**:
   ```bash
   npm run build             # Ensure build succeeds
   npm start                 # Test the full application
   ```

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add Instagram posting support"
   ```

### Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add Instagram OAuth integration
fix(formatting): resolve Unicode character counting issue
docs(setup): update LinkedIn API configuration steps
test(tagging): add edge cases for person mapping validation
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

- **Unit tests** for utility functions and pure logic
- **Component tests** for React components
- **Integration tests** for complex workflows
- **API tests** for server endpoints

### Test Structure

Tests are organized in a mixed approach:
```
tests/                    # Cross-cutting and server tests
├── auth/                # OAuth authentication flows
└── server/              # API endpoint tests

src/                     # Co-located with source code
├── utils/*.test.ts      # Utility function tests
└── components/__tests__/ # React component tests
```

### Writing Tests

1. **Follow existing patterns** in similar test files
2. **Use descriptive test names**: 
   ```javascript
   it('should convert @{Person Name} to LinkedIn format correctly', () => {
   ```

3. **Include edge cases** and error scenarios
4. **Mock external dependencies** appropriately
5. **Maintain 70%+ test coverage** (checked automatically)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test files
npm test src/utils/textFormatting.test.ts
npm test tests/auth/

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## 📋 Code Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

- **Use TypeScript** for all new code
- **Define proper types** instead of using `any`
- **Export interfaces** for reusable types
- **Use strict mode** settings (already configured)

### React Best Practices

- **Functional components** with hooks (no class components)
- **Proper prop types** with TypeScript interfaces
- **Use React.memo()** for performance optimization when needed
- **Handle loading and error states** appropriately

### Code Style

We use automated tools for consistent formatting:

- **ESLint** for code quality
- **Prettier** for code formatting (auto-configured)
- **4-space indentation**
- **Single quotes** for strings
- **Trailing commas** in multiline structures

### File Organization

```
src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── auth/           # Authentication-related components
│   ├── formatting/     # Text formatting components
│   ├── platform/       # Platform-specific components
│   └── ui/             # Generic UI components
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── services/           # API and external service interactions
├── utils/              # Pure utility functions
├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
└── constants/          # Application constants
```
